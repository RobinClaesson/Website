            <Paragraph>
                Each player is given a robot to use to collect stars.
                There is no direct way to move or interact with your robot,
                instead the game is played in two repeating phases, programming and executing.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                During the programming phase each player is given a short time to create a program
                that their robot will follow and navigate through the hazards on the map.
                Each instruction cost “Energy” to program, so you must be careful to not run out.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                Once the programming phase ends the execution phase begins, and all robots run their programs at the same time.
                If your program is too short it repeats, which can be both a benefit and a disaster.
                When robots collide, they push each other, throwing your carefully planned program out or sync with reality.
            </Paragraph>

                Combine this with conveyor belts, lasers and much more, and you get the chaos that is

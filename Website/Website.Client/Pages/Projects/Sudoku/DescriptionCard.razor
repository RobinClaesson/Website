                A .NET Sudoku solver that uses a combination of logical deduction
                and brute force to solve any Sudoku puzzle.

                It first tries to apply a series of logical rules to fill as many
                numbers as possible until no change is made. For simpler puzzles
                these rules can sometimes be enough to solve the puzzles.
                See the logical rules section for details on the used rules.

                If the logical rules are not enough to solve the puzzle the solver
                goes into a depth first brute force. It fills out the possible values
                for each remaining cells, and then picks one value for a cell and restarts
                the logical part. If it reaches a dead end it goes back up one step and
                tries another value. Since it restarts the logical rules after each "guess"
                the depth of the search is likely to be lower than the remaining number of
                cells at the first iteration.

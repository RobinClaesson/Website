                After "having" to implement a menu in a C# Console application for the millionth time, I decided to create a reusable package for it.
                CommandLineMenu is a .NET Library for creating menus that prompts the user to select an option and gives back the selected alternative.

                Menu&lt;T&gt; is the main class for creating and displaying menus. It implements IList&lt;T&gt; with the menu alternatives as the collection elements.

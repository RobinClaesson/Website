                The website has several different selectable themes.
                Each component is built using color settings such as "Primary", "Secondaty", etc.
                What color is shown for each setting is determined by the current Fluxor-state.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                The different selectable themes are loaded from a Json file and then populates
                the list of thems selectable in the settings in the lower right corner of the site.
                The intention is to later build a way to create personal custom themes that can be
                saved using local storage.

                Everything on the website is controlled by an imutable state, which state percists when changing pages on the site.
                The state can be altered by effects and reducers reacting to actions. Actions are fired by a lot of things, like clicking a button.
                This gives good control of the shifting content on the site, and allows for easier debugging as you step through actions and review the state.

                The command line client is a simple program to interact with the server. It can be used to peek, pop and push text to the server.
                It uses subcommands, or verbs, to interact with the server, such as <Text TextColor="TextColor.Info">./TextShareClient peek Foo</Text>
                which will call the peek function of the server with the id 'Foo'. The program can also be set to place all fetched texts to the
                clipboard.

            <Paragraph>
                If the client is started with the subcommand <Text TextColor="TextColor.Secondary">menu</Text> it is instead launced to a menu, where
                the user can choose their action, and also browse what id to fetch from.

                Host a server for Text Share that uses a REST API to store text to different Ids.
                It has GET access points <Text TextColor="TextColor.Info"> Peek </Text> and <Text TextColor="TextColor.Info"> Pop </Text>
                to fetch text for an id, the first leaving the text on the server while the second deleting it afterwards.
                Other GET access points exists to list the ids and text stored.
                It also has a POST access point <Text TextColor="TextColor.Info"> Push </Text> to store text to an id, appending if text already exists for the id.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
                The server has a number of options to customize the server, such as separate ports for HTTP and HTTP, only allowing localhost,
                and turning on and off HTTP and HTTPS independently.

                Lastly, the server also provides a web interface to show stored texts.
                If the program is launched with the --swagger option set, the API can be accessed in the web browser with
                <Link TextColor="TextColor.Secondary"
                      To="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/"

                Swagger UI
                </Link>.
                at /swagger/index.html. The Access API link in the web interface leading to this page is only visible if Swagger is enabled.
